Add extension manifest v2: multiple `phases` and `augments` per extension, blocking phases with one retry, `when.files` conditions, timeouts, report `outputs` injected into dependent children as "Upstream outputs", mid-run PRs via a `prUrl` output, `followUps`, and per-workspace `settings` in `openfleet/extensions.config.json`. Version 1 manifests are rejected with their v2 equivalent.
